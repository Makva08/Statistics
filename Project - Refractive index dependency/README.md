The Plasma Coating Experiment aimed to study the effects of different experimental parameters on the properties of plasma-coated silicon dioxide (SiO2) films. 

Experiment was conducted in the Birck Nanotechnology Center Cleanroom.

The primary goal was to produce high-quality coatings by carefully controlling bias power (RF1), ICP power (RF2), and chamber pressure (P). 

The quality of the coating was assessed by measuring the thickness of the film and its refractive index.

Experimental Setup:

Equipment: The experiment utilized a Plasma-Therm Apex SLR HDPCVD machine at a temperature of 170Â°C.

Sample Preparation: All Si (100) substrates underwent a 3-step solvent cleaning process using Toluene, Acetone, and IPA.

Treatment Factors and Levels:

Bias Power (RF1): 50W, 75W, 150W, 165W

ICP Power (RF2): 300W, 600W, 900W, 1000W

Chamber Pressure (P): 0.2 mTorr, 2 mTorr, 8 mTorr, 12 mTorr

Design Model: A full factorial design with 32 runs was employed to ensure statistical significance while minimizing fabrication runs. Due to an error, 33 runs were performed, which the team incorporated into the analysis.


Experimental Design:

Blocking Factors: After every 4 depositions, the chamber underwent plasma cleaning to avoid contamination, with each set of 4 depositions considered a separate block.

Randomization: Treatment combinations were randomly assigned to deposition times to prevent systematic bias.

Analysis Approach:

Statistical Model: The experiment used a three-way mixed model, examining:


Main Effects: RF1, RF2, and Pressure

Interaction Effects: Two-way interactions (RF1RF2, RF1P, RF2P) and a three-way interaction (RF1RF2*P)

Random Error: Assumed normally distributed with a mean of zero and constant variance


Distribution Analysis:

The histogram showed an approximately normal distribution, supported by a Q-Q plot.

Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial ACF (PACF) plots were analyzed for independence.


ANOVA Results:

Refractive Index: RF1 had a marginally non-significant effect (p=0.0710), while RF2 and Pressure showed no significant influence.

Film Thickness: RF1 was highly significant (p=0.0001), demonstrating a strong effect on film thickness. RF2 and Pressure did not significantly influence the thickness.

Key Findings:

RF1 Impact: High bias power (RF1) contributed significantly to thicker films, suggesting that increased power enhances deposition rate.

Non-Significant Interactions: The interaction effects between RF1 and RF2, and between pressure and power, were not significant, indicating that the main effects were the primary drivers of film properties.

Refractive Index Behavior: The refractive index showed lower values at higher bias power levels, suggesting potential changes in film density or composition.
